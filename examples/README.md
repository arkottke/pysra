# Examples

The examples included here are used to demonstrate the capabilities of `pysra`. 
The following a brief summaries of the examples:

1. Time series analysis to compute surface response spectrum and site 
amplification functions.
2. Random vibration theory (RVT) analysis to compute surface response 
spectrum and site amplification functions.
3. Alternative velocity profiles generated by geopsy used in an RVT.
